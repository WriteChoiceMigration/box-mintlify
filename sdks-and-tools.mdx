The following SDKs and tools are developed and supported by Box.

## SDKs

Here you will find a list of SDKs you can use to build your application.

The tables below list SDKs along with additional information telling you if the project is maintained and has API parity.

**Status:** Describes the current project status. To learn more about statuses visit [Box Open Source website](https://opensource.box.com/badges/). Active projects are actively developed by Box. They receive the latest security updates and new features. For support with these projects please visit GitHub or [our Platform support forum](https://community.box.com/).

**API Parity**: Projects with full API parity are actively updated with all platform functionality as this becomes available on the Box Platform. Projects with partial API parity lack some functionality while we work on bringing these projects to full parity.

### Core SDKs

The table lists Box SDKs that you can use when building your applications. For latest API support and features, use the next generation SDKs.

#### Latest SDKs

For all new development, we recommend using the latest version (v10 and above) of the Box SDKs. These SDKs are auto-generated from the Box OpenAPI specification and provide full API coverage, rapid updates, embedded documentation, and enhanced convenience methods.

#### Combined SDKs

For developers migrating from or adding new features to an existing application using earlier versions of the Box SDKs, we recommend using the combined SDKs. These SDKs provide a stable interface while still being actively maintained and updated with the latest Box Platform features.

### Salesforce Developer Toolkit

The Box for Salesforce Developer Toolkit allows customers to programmatically customize the behavior of the Box for Salesforce integration. The Toolkit consists of several global APEX methods that can be used to trigger and extend the default behavior.

<Note>
The Toolkit is not a full-featured APEX wrapper for the Box Content API. If this is what you are looking for, have a look at the [Box SDK for Salesforce](https://github.com/box/box-salesforce-sdk).
